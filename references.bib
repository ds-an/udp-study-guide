The top-down approach seeks to replicate intelligence by analyzing cognition independent of the biological structure of the brain, in terms of the processing of symbols—whence the symbolic label. The bottom-up approach, on the other hand, involves creating artificial neural networks in imitation of the brain’s structure—whence the connectionist label. To illustrate the difference between these approaches, consider the task of building a system, equipped with an optical scanner, that recognizes the letters of the alphabet. A bottom-up approach},

The problem advocates strongly for a strategy for tackling potential biases. This article thoroughly evaluates existing knowledge to enhance fairness management, which will serve as a foundation for creating a unified framework to address any bias and its subsequent mitigation method throughout the AI development pipeline. We map the software development life cycle (SDLC), machine learning life cycle (MLLC) and cross industry standard process for data mining (CRISP-DM) together to have a general understanding of how phases in these development processes are related to each other. The map should benefit researchers from multiple technical backgrounds. Biases are categorised into three distinct classes; pre-existing, technical and emergent bias, and subsequently, three mitigation strategies; conceptual, empirical and technical, along with fairness management approaches; fairness sampling, learning and certification. The recommended practices for debias and overcoming challenges encountered further set directions for successfully establishing a unified framework.},

  abstract = {Over the past few years, the evolution of AI-driven tools like GitHub’s Copilot and other large language models (LLMs) has promised to revolutionise programming. By leveraging deep learning, these tools can generate code, suggest solutions, and even troubleshoot issues in real-time, saving developers hours of work. While these tools have obvious benefits in terms of productivity, there’s a growing concern that they may also have unintended consequences on the quality and skillset of programmers.},
